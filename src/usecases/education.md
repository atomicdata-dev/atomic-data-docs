# Atomic Data for Eduction - standardized, modular e-learling

The Atomic Data specification can help make online educational content more **modular**. This has two direct benefits:

- **Separate learning goals from how they are achieved**. Some might prefer watching a video, others may want to read. Both can describe the same topic, and share the same test.
- **Improve discoverability**. Create links between topics so students know which knowledge is needed to advance to the next topic.

## Modular educational content

We can think of **knowledge** as being building blocks that we need to do certain things.
And we can think of **lessons** as _teaching_ certain pieces of knowledge, while at the same time _requiring_ other pieces of knowledge.
For example, an algebra class might require that you already know how to multiply, add, etc.
Finally, we can think of **test** as _verifying_ if a piece of knowledge is properly understood.

Describing our educational content in this fashion has a bunch of advantages.
For students, this means they can know in advance if they can get started with a course, or if they need to learn something else first.
Conversely, they can also discover new topics that depend on their previous piece of knowledge.
For teachers, this means they can re-use existing lessons for the courses.
