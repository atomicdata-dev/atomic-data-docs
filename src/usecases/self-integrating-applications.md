# Self-integrating applications with Atomic Data

Our digital workspaces are increasingly dependent on integrations.
Receive ticket updates in your group chat app, send an e-mail when a new lead is added, save uploaded files to a specific folder in your cloud storage.
Many SAAS platforms offer these types of integrations as simple click-to-enable features.
However, writing integrations as a developer pretty much always involves manual labor.
Integrations are costly, as developers will need to read API specifications, interpret them correctly,
map the properties, implement the integration and then add tests to make sure it doesn't break.

Tools like the OpenAPI specification make it easier to render

We call application _self-integrating_ if there is no labor involved with linking one app to the other.
