# Atomizing: How to create and publish Atomic Data

Now that we're familiar with the basics of Atomic Data and its Schema, it's time to create some Atomic Data!
We call the process of turning data into Atomic Data _Atomizing_.
In general, there are three ways to create Atomic Data:

- Using the **Atomic-Server** app (easy, only for direct user input)
- Create an **importable JSON-AD file** (medium, useful if you want to convert existing data)
- Make your existing service / app **host and serialize Atomic Data** (hard, if you want to make your entire app be part of the Atomic Web!)
